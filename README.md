# React Blog App integrated with AWS Amplify

+ React
+ AWS Amplify's DataStore

My introduction to AWS Amplify in the form of a blogging platform that includes a simple frontend and backend authentication to provide admin roles and restricted access to non-admins.

This project was derivative of a blog tutorial created by Ali Spittel. [https://welearncode.com/auth-react/]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
